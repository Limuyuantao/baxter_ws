# pcl_utils
This package contains some examples of using PCL.  
make_and_display_ellipse shows how to manually populate a point-cloud object, convert the PCL object to a ROS pointCloud message, and publish this message, viewable by Rviz.

pcd_snapshot is an example utility that exploits the pcl_utils library.  It waits for valid Kinect pointcloud message, then saves this message to disk as a 
PCD file by the name of kinect_snapshot.pcd.

display_pcd_file prompts for a file name, loads the file, converts it to a ROS message, and publishes this message for display in Rviz.  The
topic is "pcd" and the frame is "camera_depth_optical_frame".

find_plane_pcd_file illustrates use of pclUtils functions, as well as use of native PCL functions.  It prompts for a PCD file name, reads the file,
and (like display_pcd) converts to a ROS message and publishes it (topic is "pcd" and the frame is "camera_depth_optical_frame").  It then prompts the
user to use the "Publish Selected Points" tool to select a patch, presumed to be on a planar surface of interest.  Planar parameters of the
selected patch are returned and displayed.  The pcl::compute3DCentroid() is compared to pclUtils.compute_centroid().  

A coordinate frame is defined based on the selected patch, where the z-axis is the surface normal.  All of the original points are transformed to this frame,
then within this transformed cloud, points with near-zero z-values are identified.  These points are identified in terms of a list of indices.
These indices are used to index into the original cloud using  pclUtils.copy_cloud_xyzrgb_indices(), then these points are published on the topic "planar_pts",
viewable within Rviz.

## Example usage
An example pcd file is contained in "kinect_clr_snapshot" within the repository, Part_3/jinx_pcd.  This file is ASCII and human readable (e.g. using gedit).
Start up a roscore, start up Rviz.  
In another terminal, navigate to the directory containing the point-cloud file.  Run display_pcd_file or find_plane_pcd_file.  Respond to the prompt
with a valid PCD file name (e.g. kinect_clr_snapshot).

Note: to use a physical Kinect device, plug the USB cable into the SAME computer that runs the Kinect
driver code, and start the  driver  code with:
`roslaunch freenect_launch freenect.launch`

Topic: /camera/depth_registered/points
frame: camera_rgb_optical_frame or camera_depth_frame

also, "publish selected patch"  is better than "publish selected points" tool in rviz.
Rviz will  crash if select too many points.  Best to display the downsampled version,  so fewer points
are selected and republished.
